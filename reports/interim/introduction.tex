\chapter{Introduction and background}
The EduCraft project is concerned with developing a series of extensions
(`mods') for the popular computer game Minecraft, aimed at promoting
collaborative learning in primary schools, particularly with reference
to numeracy education. In this first section, some of the advantages of
collaborative learning are explored in contrast to conventional teaching
methods, and the game of Minecraft is introduced in the context of education.

``Minecraft is a game about breaking and placing blocks. At first, people
built structures to protect against nocturnal monsters, but as the game grew
players worked together to create wonderful, imaginative things.''

Minecraft was initially developed in 2009, as a game where players could
explore a randomly-generated world and place blocks to build structures. From
the outset, Minecraft was not designed as a game that could be `won'---in
game industry terms, it was intended to be a `sandbox' game where players set
their own goals.

There have been several articles written exploring the potential for Minecraft
to be used in education\cite{brand13}.
